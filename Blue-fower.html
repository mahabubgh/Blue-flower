    <h4>"git" can mean anything, depending on your mood.

        Random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
        Stupid. Contemptible and despicable. Simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.
        "Global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
        "Goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks.</h4>
