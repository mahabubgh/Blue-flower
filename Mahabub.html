            <h2>JAKARTA: Indonesia's highest Muslim clerical council has called for a review of guidelines on the use of loudspeakers at mosques, following concerns and complaints from members of the public in the world's largest Muslim-majority country.</h2>
            <h3>There are nearly 625,000 mosques across the vast Indonesian archipelago, where over 80 percent of the 270 million population professes Islam. Most of the mosques use loudspeakers to play the azan, or call to prayer, and sermons. Many of them have poor acoustics and set the volume high, resulting in complaints over noise pollution.</h3>

            <h1>Definition of Mosque or Masjid in Islam
            Mosques, or masjids, are Muslim places of worship</h1>
            <h2>"Mosque" is the English name for a place of Muslim worship, equivalent to a church, synagogue or temple in other faiths. The Arabic term for this house of Muslim worship is "masjid," which literally means "place of prostration" (in prayer). Mosques are also known as Islamic centers, Islamic community centers or Muslim community centers. During Ramadan, Muslims spend a lot of time at the masjid, or mosque, for special prayers and community events.</h2>
            <h3>Some Muslims prefer to use the Arabic term and discourage use of the word "mosque" in English. This is partly based on a mistaken belief that the English word is derived from the word "mosquito" and is a derogatory term. Others simply prefer to use the Arabic term, as it more accurately describes the purpose and activities of a mosque using Arabic, which is the language of the Quran.</h3>
